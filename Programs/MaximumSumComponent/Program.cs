using System;
 /*
 Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges. Every node has been assigned a value. 
 The task is to find the connected chain with the maximum sum of values among all the connected components in the graph.

Example 1:

Input: 
V = 7, E = 4 
Values = {10, 25, 5, 15, 5, 20, 0} 
Edges={ {1,2} ,{3,4}, {4,5} ,{6,7} }
Output: 35
Explanation: The graph looks like
1     3      5       6
|       \   /        |  
2         4          7
Component {1, 2} has Value {10, 25}: 
sumValue = 10 + 25 = 35 

Component {3, 4, 5}  has Value {5, 15, 5}: 
sumValue = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 

Component {6, 7} has Value {20, 0}: 
sumValue = 20 + 0 = 20 

Max Sum value chain is {1, 2} with values 
{10, 25}, hence 35 is the answer. 
 

Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve() that takes
V (number of vertices in the graph),
E(number of edges in the graph),
Values( Values[i] represent the value of i+1th node),
Edges (Edges[i][0] is connected with Edges[i][1] ) 
as input parameters and returns the maximum sum of values of the node which are present in the same component.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)

 

Constraints:
1<=V<=1e5 
0<=E<=min( V*(V-1)/2 , 1e5 )
1<=Values[i]<=1e5 
1<=Edges[i][0],Edges[i][1] <=V
Graph doesn't contain multiple edges and self loops.
